**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
Removes some environmental related tooltips (hot/cold/wet) from appearing at the bottom of the screen.
Currently only the "You are Wet" tooltip is removed , but  other environmental buffs are in the mod and are commented out, you should just be abel to remove the comments for the debuff tooltip you want to silence/remove.
This is a template mod giving examples so you can more easily determine if you want to add other tooltips to remove

Why?
- Was a request from a comment on the 7daystodiemods.com site
- Some tooltips pop up frequently and this is an example mod that removes some of them, and can be used as a template to remove more is you wish.
