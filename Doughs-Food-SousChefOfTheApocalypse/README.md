**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
This modlet adds mods food items and recipes.
Purposefully no new icons/models so its server side safe.

**Note**: This mod is intended to be the initial "Food Expansion Pack" to "Doughs-You've Got Mail",
and both can be installed together or separately. Additional "story" for this will come at some other time.
Eventually they may both be merged together.

Some items can be found in containers, or bought at traders. Item semi-rarity is hopefully a norm as you are supposed to be cooking and preparing, not buying and finding!

It "currantly" includes:
- New perk: Sous Chef of the Apocalypse.  Works similar to vanilla perk Master Chef but with its own special foods
- 4 New Cookbooks to unlock certain foods/ingredients
- 20 New Schematics to unlock certain foods/ingredients
- 55+ Food/drink items (either found/crafted/perk unlock/or schematic):
