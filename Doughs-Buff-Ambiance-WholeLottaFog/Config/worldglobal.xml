  <!-- The values are Day,Night 
  The numbers are not "how much fog" but more of "How much visibility"
  so a higher number is more visibility. I do noy know if its a percentage but that would make sense
  Vales go from 0 (no visibilty) to 1 (no fog I guess?)
  Possibly just a 2 decimal number, I have not tested more decimals
  Leading 0 is optional.
