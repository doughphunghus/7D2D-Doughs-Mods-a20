**Description**: This modlet adds a very powerful, feral rabbit.  Run Away! Run Away!
For those unfamiliar: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_of_Caerbannog)

NOTE: The rabbit does not spawn very frequently in this modlet. To remedy this, this additional modlet is available if you want to also load it to increase the spawn rate:
