**Description**: This modlet adds a very powerful, feral rabbit.  Run Away! Run Away!
For those unfamiliar: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_of_Caerbannog)

NOTE: The rabbit does not spawn rate is usually 1%, and increases up to 3% in the wasteland biome and in certain hordes. If something is set as a "cave" its 5%... which may be excessive if caves come back...
