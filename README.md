# 7D2D-Doughs-Mods-a20

I will post my mods that have been converted for a20 here. Please note the version they were tested/built on in case they do not work properly in later a20 builds.

I do not plan on updating any mod during/for a20 "experimental" releases unless by request.  I have a statement about my mods and converting them to a20 here: https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/17197-doughs-modlets/page/10/?tab=comments#comment-451231 but essentially "I'll try to convert by request" and once a20 is "not experimental" I'm begin converting/testing/updating them all to a20 "stable"
